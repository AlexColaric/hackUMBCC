              <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            
            <p>We were inspired to create this project looking at two issues that surround college campuses, cost and waste. We decided to create a platform for UMBC students to give away their stuff that they don't want anymore to other UMBC students, cutting down the burden of costs for others to obtain those items and reducing overall waste. </p>
            
            <h2>What it does</h2>
            
            <p>This website is a collaboration platform where students login through their UMBC account and they can create posts sharing the stuff they wish to give away. Other students can then interact with these posts and take the stuff off their hands. </p>
            
            <h2>How we built it</h2>
            
            <p>We built this by first following a model for system engineering which included, planning, analysis, design, and finally implementation. We conducted research, gathered system requirements, created data models, designed the data flow of the website, and then created a prototype. For our prototype, we used Visual Studio code, Visual Studio Code Sharing Extension, and HTML. </p>
            
            <h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
            
            <p>None of us were familiar with Visual Studio Code or HTML before starting this project, so it took us a while to figure out how to navigate that before we were able to start conducting any of our coding. </p>
            
            <h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
            
            <p>We feel proud of how much we were able to finish given the very short timeline of this project. We started off Friday not even knowing what HackUMBC was or what we wanted our project to be and we made a lot of progress from where we've started. </p>
            
            <h2>What we learned</h2>
            
            <p>We learned how to navigate GitHub more effectively, how to share code on Visual Studio, and how to write code in HTML. We also learned about NoSQL vs SQL to determine which kind of databases we would like to see for the backend of our project. </p>
            
            <h2>What's next for Fetch&amp;Retrieve</h2>
            
            <p>What's next for Fetch&amp;Retrieve is hopefully further development of the website and a collaboration with the Office of Sustainability at UMBC. </p>
